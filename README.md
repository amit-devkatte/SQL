SQL and Python Target E-commerce Project Summary
Project Overview
The project involves analyzing an e-commerce dataset using SQL and Python to derive meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions. The primary dataset, referred to as the "Target dataset," includes various aspects of an e-commerce business such as customer information, product details, sales transactions, and more.

Objectives
Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Inspect the dataset to understand its structure.
Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
SQL Analysis:

Use SQL queries to explore the dataset.
Perform operations such as filtering, grouping, and aggregating data to extract insights.
Generate reports on sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, etc.
Python Analysis:

Utilize Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy) for further data manipulation and analysis.
Visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn to identify patterns and trends.
Implement machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification) to predict future sales and customer preferences.
Integration of SQL and Python:

Combine SQL and Python to streamline data extraction and analysis.
Use SQL for data retrieval and Python for advanced analytics and visualization.
Key Tasks and Deliverables
Data Import and Cleaning:

Import the Target dataset into SQL and Python environments.
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
SQL Queries:

Write SQL queries to explore and analyze the dataset.
Create views and stored procedures for recurrent analysis tasks.
Generate reports on key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and customer lifetime value.
Python Analysis:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.
Develop visualizations to support findings from SQL analysis.
Build predictive models to forecast sales and customer trends.
Reporting and Visualization:

Create dashboards and visual reports to present findings.
Summarize insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
Tools and Technologies
SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite for database management and querying.
Python: pandas, numpy for data manipulation; matplotlib, seaborn for visualization; scikit-learn for machine learning.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive Python development and documentation.
BI Tools: Tableau or Power BI for creating interactive dashboards (optional).
Expected Outcomes
A comprehensive understanding of the e-commerce business dynamics.
Data-driven insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
Predictive models to aid in business decision-making.
Visual reports and dashboards to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.
By leveraging both SQL and Python, this project aims to provide a robust analytical framework to drive strategic decisions for the e-commerce business.
