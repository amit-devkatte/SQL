Objectives
Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Inspect the dataset to understand its structure.
Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
SQL Analysis:

Use SQL queries to explore the dataset.
Perform operations such as filtering, grouping, and aggregating data to extract insights.
Generate reports on sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, etc.

Python Analysis:

Utilize Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy) for further data manipulation and analysis.
Visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn to identify patterns and trends.
Implement machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification) to predict future sales and customer preferences.

Integration of SQL and Python:

Combine SQL and Python to streamline data extraction and analysis.
Use SQL for data retrieval and Python for advanced analytics and visualization.
Key Tasks and Deliverables
Data Import and Cleaning:

Import the Target dataset into SQL and Python environments.
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.

SQL Queries:

Write SQL queries to explore and analyze the dataset.
Create views and stored procedures for recurrent analysis tasks.
Generate reports on key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and customer lifetime value.
Python Analysis:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.
Develop visualizations to support findings from SQL analysis.
Build predictive models to forecast sales and customer trends.
Reporting and Visualization:

Create dashboards and visual reports to present findings.
